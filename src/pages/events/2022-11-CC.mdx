description: |
  We are back with another round of Colourful Conversations! Come in and get to play board games and network with professors and just have a good time. As always the goal is to let professors get to know their LGBTQ+ students better and for LGBTQ+ students to network with professors in a relaxed setting. We will have free food and coffee available for attendants. 

  Colourful Conversations was created with LGBTQ+ in Computer Science & adjacent fields in mind. But the event is open to everyone, queer or not.

  This round we are featuring Vered Shwartz, an Artificial Intelligence professor, and Tamara Munzner, who researches Info Visualization.
