description: |
  Our first Colourful Conversation of the year is here!

  Come enjoy some baked goods and board games while speaking to your peers and professors. Colourful Conversations aims to build a connection between professors and their LGBT+ students, providing a safe and fun environment for everyone to network. The event was created with LGBTQ+ identities in Computer Science and adjacent fields in mind, but is always welcoming of all attendees, regardless of your identity and major. 

  This month, we welcome Professor Steve Wolfman, whose research focuses on Technology and Education; and Professor Rachel Pottinger, whose focus is Database Management and Mining. Get the opportunity to speak to them and exercise your board game skills and sweet tooth!

  Sign up here: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_4TUFE7ziNre7KRw (capacity limited to 40 attendants)
  If the sign up is full, please sign up on our waitlist: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_aeOmUaalA412EeO 
  Waitlist members will be informed if space becomes available.

  Update:
  we have decided to postpone the Colourful Conversation event due to the weather conditions. 

  Our new time is Thursday, March 9th at the same time (5-7pm). Everyone who signed up will still be on the list, however, please let us know if you cannot make this new time.

  Wishing everyone a safe day. Looking forward to next week!
