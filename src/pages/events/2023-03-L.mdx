description: |
  We have another event IN ADDITION TO colourful conversations happening next week. Queer Coded and Prof Margo Seltzer are co-hosting a drop-in lunch and chat with a visiting researcher, Dr Elizabeth Fischer, on Monday, March 6th from 11am-1pm in ICCS X860. You can come by any time within that window, grab some food, and meet our guest. Sign up for the lunch here: https://ubc.ca1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1IjsIwjNEQSb1Wu

  Elizabeth will also be giving a talk later in the day, from 3pm-4pm. Her career path is super interesting, starting out with a PhD in CS (supervised by Margo!) and eventually becoming an earth scientist.
