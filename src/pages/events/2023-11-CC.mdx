  Come meet with Computer Science professors and fellow students. Enjoy some sweet treats while playing board games and having meaningful conversations. The event provides a safe space for LBGTQ+ identities in Computer Science and adjacent fields, but is always welcoming of all attendees, regardless of your identity and major.
